- Beginning section 1, this opening could be much stronger if you had more parallelism. Something like
    "In math, you state a proposition, you write a proof, and then anyone can verify that your proof is correct"
- Beginning section 1, I think you brush over the concept of a mathematical statement a little too quickly
    I imagine that a given proof system can only work for a certain language of mathematical predicates
    and this is a subtle concept that I think would be confusing to anyone unfamiliar with formal logic.
- Bottom page 1, I understand that graph colorings are supposed to be known by the reader, 
    but I feel that bringing up a concrete example and then not really explaining 
    what the problem is or why is you pick it is not a good idea
- Beginning section 2, Field theory (or abstract algebra in general) is not one of the things you say a 
    reader should come in knowing. Therefore I think you should specialize to a specific field in the 
    problem statement (rational numbers could be a good choice), you can then add to the end that 
    the algorithm is more powerful and can be applied to domains relevant to cryptography
    Alternatively, maybe specialize to the field of integers mod some prime.
    Alternatively, maybe give me some more intuition on why this is an important problem.
    In the abstract you say that zero knowledge proofs are important in cryptography,
    how do they allow me to either securely send or verify authenticity of some information?
    I also don't know what the super-polynomial algorithm is.
- Beginning 2, you mention the term protocol several times.
    Is there an important difference between a protocol and an algorithm?
    If so, does the reader need to know it? 
    Then you should probably dedicate more space to introducing it.
- Section 2, in general I think you need to go a lot slower.
    Introduce topics and give intuition before going straight for the mathematical definitions
