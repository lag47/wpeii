This paper provides an introduction to quantum programming and an overview of two strongly typed quantum programming langugaes.

The Quantum Lambda Calculus is a linearly typed functional programming language for quantum programming that is structured like a normal lambda calculus.
Qwire separates out quantum programs into a classical host language, with any kind of type system, and a quantum circuit language, with a linear type system.
Both languages work at the level of abstraction of applying gates to qubits, and using higher level program constructs to aid in designing circuits.
